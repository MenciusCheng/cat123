Meteor Notes
============

Introducing the [Meteor Guide](http://guide.meteor.com/).

Meteor Guide
------------

The APIs of the Meteor platform are available a the [docs site](https://docs.meteor.com/), and you can browse community packages on [atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/).

If you are just getting started with Meteor, we recommend starting with the [official tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app).

-----------------

If you find a bug or error in the tutorial, please file an issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/meteor/tutorials).

All of the code in your HTML files is compiled with [Meteor's Spacebars compiler](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/spacebars/README.md).

With Meteor methods and optimistic UI, you get the best of both worlds — the security of server code and no round-trip delay. Read more in our [blog post about optimistic UI](http://info.meteor.com/blog/optimistic-ui-with-meteor-latency-compensation).

Explore [tools](https://www.meteor.com/tools) and [resources](https://www.meteor.com/tools/resources) to help you build Meteor apps.
